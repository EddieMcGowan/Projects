ðŸš€ **Author:** Eddie McGowan 
ðŸ“… **Last Updated:** February 2025  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains two machine learning projects demonstrating expertise in **recommendation systems** and **generative AI**:  

1. **Movie Recommendation System** â€“ Built and evaluated five movie recommendation models using collaborative filtering and the ALS algorithm in Spark.  
2. **High-Performance Computing Text-To-Image Model** â€“ Deployed a Generative AI model on a high-performance computing cluster, optimizing it for text-to-image generation.  

## **Movie Recommendation System (Dec 2024)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Develop a system to recommend movies based on user preferences.  
ðŸ”¹ **Methods Used:**  
- **Collaborative filtering** (user-based & item-based)  
- **Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm** in Spark  
- **Baseline models** (random, popularity-based, highest-rated)  

ðŸ”¹ **Evaluation Metrics:**  
- **Quantitative:** RMSE, MAE, AUC  
- **Qualitative:** User survey-based evaluation  

ðŸ”¹ **Technologies:**  
- **Apache Spark** (PySpark)  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, SciPy**  

## **Text-To-Image Model on HPC (May 2024)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Deploy a generative AI text-to-image model on a high-performance computing cluster and compare its outputs to commercial models.  
ðŸ”¹ **Model:**  
- 45M-parameter Generative AI model  
- Fine-tuned for specific text/image categories  

ðŸ”¹ **Optimization:**  
- HPC deployment for improved speed  
- Performance comparison against commercial models  

ðŸ”¹ **Technologies:**  
- **Python** (PyTorch, TensorFlow)  
- **HPC Cluster**  
- **CUDA / GPU Acceleration**  

## **Results & Findings**  
- The ALS-based recommendation model outperformed baseline models in RMSE.  
- The HPC-deployed text-to-image model was effective at generative images based upon a user's input.

## **Next Steps**  
- Improve model scalability for real-world deployment.  
- Experiment with **deep-learning-based recommendation systems**.  
- Expand text-to-image model categories and optimize diffusion models.
